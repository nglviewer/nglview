        How does this work?

        First, try to pop all callbacks and execute them, if loadFile
        then wait until getting 'ok' signal from NGL. Calling those callbacks
        will block execution from other threads. This is why we let this thread
        run forever in background. This thread is usually sleeping all the time
        and let other threads do the work. It "wake up" only if its 'q' is added more
        callbacks.

        This class is needed if use call 
        add_trajectory, clear, add_representation, ... in the same notebook cell
